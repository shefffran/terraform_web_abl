Let's start configuring terraform with aws s3 bucket as backend for state and lock.
I want to have a website with high-availability in us-east-1a and us-east-1b. Pick up any domain you want for testing, it should be a valid and public domain.

Then, let's create
* VPC
* 1 public and 2 private subnets
* EC2 with 2 x t3a.micro instances inside private subnet
***** EC2 instances should be having nginx installed and configured through UserData automatically when the server is first booted
* 1 x ALB with SSL certificate by using ACM - take any domain you want
* ALB target group should be pointing to EC2 instances
When all above is ready, you need to configure DNS to point your website to ALB.

Let me know if you have any questions.sz
